        [Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
        Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
        I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
        Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
        But I hope I never see them again
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
        I know it breaks your heart
        Moved to the city in a broke-down car
        And four years, no calls
        Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
        And I-I-I can't stop
        No, I-I-I can't stop
        
        [Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
        So, baby, pull me closer
        In the backseat of your Rover
        That I know you can't afford
        Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
        Pull the sheets right off the corner
        Of the mattress that you stole
        From your roommate back in Boulder
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        
        [Instrumental Break]

        [Verse 2: Halsey]
        You look as good as the day I met you
        I forget just why I left you, I was insane
        Stay and play that blink-182 song
        That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Andrew Taggart]
        I know it breaks your heart
        Moved to the city in a broke-down car
        And four years, no call
        Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
        And I-I-I can't stop
        No, I-I-I can't stop
        
        [Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
        So, baby, pull me closer
        In the backseat of your Rover
        That I know you can't afford
        Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
        Pull the sheets right off the corner
        Of the mattress that you stole
        From your roommate back in Boulder
        We ain't ever gettin' older

        We ain't ever gettin' older
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        
        [Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
        So, baby, pull me closer
        In the backseat of your Rover
        That I know you can't afford
        Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

        [Bridge: Andrew Taggart, Halsey, Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        No, we ain't ever gettin' older
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        No, we ain't ever gettin' older
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        We ain't ever gettin' older
        No, we ain't ever gettin' older
